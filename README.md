# Riak KV

![Riak KV OpenRiak Status](https://github.com/OpenRiak/riak_kv/actions/workflows/erlang.yml/badge.svg?branch=openriak-3.4)

## Overview

Riak KV is an open source Erlang application that is distributed using the [riak_core](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv) Erlang
library. Riak KV provides a key/value datastore and features MapReduce, lightweight data relations, and several different client APIs.

## Quick Start

You must have [Erlang/OTP 22](http://erlang.org/download.html) or later and a GNU-style build system to compile and run Riak KV. The easiest way to utilise Riak KV is by installing the full Riak application available on [Github](https://github.com/basho/riak).
